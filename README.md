## To do maybe

1. Refresh widget automatically
2. List of favorite locations
3. Location picker for entire EU
4. PL/EN language switch
5. Better UX

## Notes

I do not have any, like zero, experience with mobile app development, Dart, Kotlin and so on.

The reason why I went through the trouble of crafting this app was that ~ a year ago similar cool application stopped working and there was no alternative app available on the market with the home screen widget feature.

Then I heard about Flutter ðŸ¤£
